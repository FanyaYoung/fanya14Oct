<p>On March 31, 2014, I was raped in my apartment. I was drugged. I reported it to the San Francisco Police Department a few hours after. Despite SVU (Sexual Victim&#39;s Unit) investigating the matter,&nbsp;</p>

<p>DNA evidence of the crime being seized, and video of the assailants getting off of the elevator within 10 minutes no more after I returned to my apartment, nothing was done.</p>

<p>In fact, the investigating officer, Sgt. Karow of SFPD*, wanted to drop the case in early September 2014. I left numerous messages for him to no avail. He never returned any of my calls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, I insisted on meeting with him with Ms. Ticas, a Victim/Witness Advocate. Ms. Ticas reported to me that he wanted me to call him to talk with me. I refused.</p>

<p>This is the reason why I did not want to practice law any more. I lost faith in the justice system. I really believed in the phrase &quot;...and justice for all, but I was wrong. &quot;Justice for some, not others.&quot;</p>

<p>SFPD may not do the right thing...like doing their job.... but I can do something: be myself, be encouraging, be loving, and be happy.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I have to say thank you to my family, especially my father, sisters, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Thank you to my Friends, Mr., NS, MS, and my including my ex&#39;s AS and especially, AL and JC, who immediately came over, nurtured me, and helped me. And to everyone, who helped me throughout this situation. I thank you, from the bottom of my heart. And, thanks for letting me be honest about this painful episode of my life. I think I finally have the ability to heal from this... so, thank you.</p>

<p>* Four days after harass I demanded a meeting via Ms. Ticas, Sgt. Karow was transferred to another station.<br />
with</p>

<p>**It should be noted that I insisted on meeting with Sgt. Karow&#39;s supervisor. After 4 weeks of stalling, he agreed to meet with me and At that meeting, he announced that all of the DNA evidence had been termed in... on December 2, 2014. Karow had turned it in that morning, the day of the meeting. Thus, SFPD failed to turn ANY of the evidence (e.g. DNA, video footage, cellphone video, bedsheets with a crusty, white stain apprx.4&quot; long, the size of a small stream of liquid) until December 2, 2014. Nothing has been done to Karow, the evidence, or the perpetrators.</p>
